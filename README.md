Sinara is an open-source hardware ecosystem designed for use in quantum physics experiments running the [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/) operating system. You can find documentation, including advice on purchasing hardware and contributing to the project, on the GitHub project [Wiki](https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/wiki).

The Metlino and Sayma PCBs are developed by a collaboration including M-Labs, Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the University of Oxford, the University of Maryland and NIST Boulder. The majority of the hardware was designed by WUT and ARTIQ integration is provided by M-Labs. The development is funded by ARL, Duke University and the University of Oxford. 

The Kasli PCB is being developed by M-Labs. The hardware is designed by WUT and ARTIQ integration is provided by M-Labs. The work was funded by ___. 

Several partners are contributing peripherals compatible with the Sinara hardware.
