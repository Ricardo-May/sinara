Sinara is an open-source hardware ecosystem originally designed for use in quantum physics experiments running the [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/) control software. You can find documentation, including advice on purchasing hardware or contributing to the project, on the GitHub project [Wiki](https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/wiki).

Sinara is currently developed by a collaboration including M-Labs, Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the University of Oxford, the University of Maryland and NIST. The majority of the hardware was designed by WUT. The work was funded by ARL, Duke University, and the University of Oxford. 

All work is licensed under CERN OHL v1.2.
